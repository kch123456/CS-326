    <h2>Secure Note Sharing Platform</h2>
    <p id='overview'>
        The platform is a web-based one that is aimed at providing teams with a platform for interaction and sharing
        files that is secure. and manage projects securely. In the time when cyber attacks are becoming more and more
        advanced, the application plays the role of a guardian of private information and data. centres primarily on the
        fact that any communication or shared resources should be encrypted and not be made available to unauthorized.
        access. The intended users of the application are remote teams, freelancers, and companies retaining offshore
        offices. so that it offers a secure way to cooperate over the Internet without affecting the user experience.

    </p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p id='application-parts'>
        Secure User Authentication System: A strong system that gives only the users who are authorized to have access
        to the application. It deals with the use of secure login technologies, password encryption, and possibly
        accessing the second-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security.

        Encrypted Chat and Communication Module: This part offers a secure instant messaging system that does not allow
        any third party to view the messages in transit. It guarantees that no information on which the team members are
        working is intercepted and cannot be obtained by unauthorized access or seen by third parties.

        Project and Task Management Tools: Tools that are created to enable efficient project management such as task
        assignment, tracking progress, and also deadline management. This part is the one to be implemented with
        JavaScript for the sake of access to dynamic updates and interactions. This will provide a smooth and responsive
        user experience.

    </p>
    <h2>Data-Requirements</h2>
    <p id="data-requirements">
        User Authentication and Authorization Data: To ensure a secured environment, Users will need to create account prior to using our application. User data such as username, password, emails, etc... will be
        stored in the back-end. This is used to verify the identity of a user who is attempting to access a system and ensure a secured system.
        Encrypted Communication Data: Public and private keys will be stored as well for encryption and description.
        Backup Recovery Data:

        <h2>Wire Frames</h2>

        two inputs username and password. Also it will have a create acount option for new users. The second interface would be user account dashboard. In this interface
        the user can navigate to different tabs such as project management, and inbox. On the right side, the interface would display project deadlines, inbox
        updates and more. In the project management interface, user will be given the option to upload/create new projects and also edit/view existing projects.

    <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
    <p id="real-world">
        In today's world we communicate the majority of the time online and keeping shared information safe has become
        very important.
        The secure note sharing platform is tackling a real world issue - the need for private and secure communication.
        Our platform will employ client-side encryption to ensure that shared notes remain confidential, and only those
        with an appropriate decryption key will be able to access the data.
        Recent events have underscored the urgency of this issue. For example, a significant data breach at AT&T
        highlighted the vulnerabilities that exist even within well-established communication networks.
        Such events expose personal and sensitive information which can lead to a loss of trust from the customers. Our
        platform aims to mitigate these risks.
        In addition another real world problem our platform tackles is defense against unwanted spying and gathering of
        personal information.
        In this day and age our digital footprints are constantly monitored and monetized, maintaining privacy becomes
        even more challenging.
        Our platform is able to ensure that our data remains protected from unwanted surveillance by encrypting the data
        client-side making it only accessible to those you have the appropriate decryption key.
        So even if data is intercepted it makes it impossible to decrypt.
