    <h2>Secure Note Sharing Platform</h2>
    <p id="overview">
        The platform is a web-based one that is aimed at providing teams with a platform for interaction and sharing
        files that is secure. and manage projects securely. In the time when cyber attacks are becoming more and more
        advanced, the application plays the role of a guardian of private information and data. centres primarily on the
        fact that any communication or shared resources should be encrypted and not be made available to unauthorized.
        access. The intended users of the application are remote teams, freelancers, and companies retaining offshore
        offices. so that it offers a secure way to cooperate over the Internet without affecting the user experience.

    </p>
    <h2>Application</h2>
    <p id="application-parts">
        Secure User Authentication System: A strong system that gives only the users who are authorized to have access
        to the application. It deals with the use of secure login technologies, password encryption, and possibly
        accessing the second-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security. <br>
        <br>
        Encrypted Chat and Communication Module: This part offers a secure instant messaging system that does not allow
        any third party to view the messages in transit. It guarantees that no information on which the team members are
        working is intercepted and cannot be obtained by unauthorized access or seen by third parties. <br>
        <br>
        Project and Task Management Tools: Tools that are created to enable efficient project management such as task
        assignment, tracking progress, and also deadline management. This part is the one to be implemented with
        JavaScript for the sake of access to dynamic updates and interactions. This will provide a smooth and responsive
        user experience. <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Data-Requirements</h2>
    <p id="data-requirements">
        In recent times, cyber threats have become more advanced. Techniques such as data breach, social engineering, and phishing often cause massive damage to individuals and corporations. To address this, we want to build a platform that aims  to enhance the security of file transferring  and project management. Our primary focus on this application is to ensure a secure and efficient file transfer environment for users. And also provide a platform for teams to organize and manage their projects safely. To ensure a safe and secured system. Information such as User Authentication/Authorization Data, Encrypted Communication Data, and Backup Recovery Data will be crucial to our application. <br>
        <br>
        User Authentication and Authorization Data are one of the most important data that we will need for the purpose of establishing and verifying user identities. When a user first uses our application, they will be prompted to make an account, using data such as email to set up their username and password. This information will serve as their unique credentials, allowing them access to the platform's features and functionalities. After which, the user credential data will be stored in the back-end for user authentication in the future. <br>
        <br>
        Since our application supports the function of transferring files and messages. Data such as public and private keys will be essential for encryption and decryption. This will be the data that we want to protect the most. Upon creating an account, users will be given a public and private key. All of which will be stored in the back-end for encryption and decryption. These keys will ensure that sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access during transmission and storage. <br>
        <br>
        Our application handles data transfer and project management. It is essential that we have back-up data to recover from in the event of cyber attacks or system failures. Data such as files and messages will be stored in the back-end to maintain an effective backup system. <br>
        <br>
        In conclusion, to ensure a safe and secured data transfer platform. Data such as Authentication/Authorization Data, Encrypted Communication Data, and Backup Recovery Data will serve as the backbone of our application. These data will allow us to verify user identities, encrypt and decrypt files, and recover from any unprecedented events. <br>
        

        </p>
        <h2>Wire Frames</h2>
        <p>
        The user will be prompted to make an account.The second interface would be user account dashboard. In this interface
        the user can navigate to different tabs such as project management, and inbox. On the right side, the interface would display project deadlines, inbox
        updates and more. In the project management interface, user will be given the option to upload/create new projects and also edit/view existing projects.
        </p>
            <div class = "wire-frame">
                        <img src="/images/icon.png" class="image" alt="frame1">
                        <p>The user starts by logging in or creating an account. Upon successful authentication, they are redirected to the dashboard.
                        The dashboard will provide an overview of projects, tasks, notifications, and recent activity.</p>
                        <img src="/images/icon.png" class="image" alt="frame2">
                        <p>Users will be able to create new projects and view existing ones. Each project displays basic details like title, description, and members.
                            Users can do numbers of things such as setting deadlines, assigning tasks, and tracking progressive in the project management interface.</p>

    <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
    <p id="real-world">
        In today's world we communicate the majority of the time online and keeping shared information safe has become
        very important.
        The secure note sharing platform is tackling a real world issue - the need for private and secure communication.
        Our platform will employ client-side encryption to ensure that shared notes remain confidential, and only those
        with an appropriate decryption key will be able to access the data.
        Recent events have underscored the urgency of this issue. For example, a significant data breach at AT&amp;T
        highlighted the vulnerabilities that exist even within well-established communication networks.
        Such events expose personal and sensitive information which can lead to a loss of trust from the customers. Our
        platform aims to mitigate these risks.
        In addition another real world problem our platform tackles is defense against unwanted spying and gathering of
        personal information.
        In this day and age our digital footprints are constantly monitored and monetized, maintaining privacy becomes
        even more challenging.
        Our platform is able to ensure that our data remains protected from unwanted surveillance by encrypting the data
        client-side making it only accessible to those you have the appropriate decryption key.
        So even if data is intercepted it makes it impossible to decrypt.
    </p>
    <h2>Integrative-Experience</h2>
    <p id="integrative-experience">
        This project and the ideas integrated within it greatly reflect our collective culmination of the computer science 
        education provided at Umass Amherst and our personal growth. As a group, we have drawn upon our diverse academic 
        backgrounds, whether it be CS or its subdivisions, and individual experiences to craft a comprehensive proposal—the 
        Secure Note-Sharing platform. To name a few courses, each member of this project has taken courses such as programming methodology, 
        Introduction to algorithms, and Data Analytics, equipping us with knowledge in JS, C, and data collection, management, and manipulation 
        with Python—skills that are truly necessary when implementing our project. Beyond the classroom, our personal experiences have further 
        enriched our project concept and development. Namely, the hardships experienced when working on a project and securely sharing notes 
        at Umass Amherst have also further fueled the motivation for the implementation and deployment of this platform. In general, our 
        group's IE represents a collection of academic knowledge, technical skills, and collaborative spirit. By leveraging our collective 
        expertise and perspective, we have created the proposal for a Secure Note-Sharing Platform.
